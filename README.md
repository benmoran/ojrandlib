ojrandlib
=========

OneJoker random number generator library.

This library provides a lot of the necessary "filler" code needed for pseudo-random number generation algorithms, making it easy to build a complete library around a new algorithm. This includes things like seed management, integer and floating point conversions, and language bindings for C, C++, Java, and Python. It also contains a few of the most popular algorithms ready-to-use.
